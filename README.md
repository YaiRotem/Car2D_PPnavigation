# Car2D_PPnavigation

This project is made in order to learn using GIT and writing the first program in C++.
In this project I will create Vehicle in 2D invironment that will follow a path created in advance.
The vehicle will use pure persuite in order to do that. For its dynamic movement I will use the simple Bicycle Model.
The discription of the model can be found in the next link: https://dingyan89.medium.com/simple-understanding-of-kinematic-bicycle-model-81cac6420357
